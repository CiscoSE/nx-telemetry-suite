# NX Telemetry Suite

Configure and visualize Nexus telemetry in a single place


## Business/Technical Challenge

Get the correct telemetry streams may be tricky, but even more is to get the correct stack of time series database, querying and visualization

## Proposed Solution

The solution will take care of all aspects of telemetry configuration in Nexus devices from a nice user interface,
but will also provide different ways of consuming that telemetry, all in one system. 

Having control of the telemetry, alerts can be created and directed to Situation Manager for further processing or 
notifications to webex teams
